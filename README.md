# Local Query System Using Gemini, RAG, and Vector Stores

## Overview  
This project provides a step-by-step guide to building a query system for local data using the free Gemini model, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and vector stores. The system enables efficient querying and retrieval of relevant data while leveraging AI-powered insights.  This file includes instructions on setting up the environment, configuring dependencies, and executing queries efficiently. Additionally, it covers best practices for optimizing performance and troubleshooting common issues.

## Features  
- Leverages **Google Gemini** for AI-powered responses  
- Implements **RAG** for enhanced query relevance  
- Utilizes **vector stores** for efficient data retrieval  
- Supports local data processing and storage

## Environment
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.12.3
- pip 
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Troubleshooting
Issue: Model not responding
       Ensure the API key is valid
       Check if dependencies are installed correctly

Issue: Slow query responses
       Optimize vector store indexing
       Increase system resources if necessary
